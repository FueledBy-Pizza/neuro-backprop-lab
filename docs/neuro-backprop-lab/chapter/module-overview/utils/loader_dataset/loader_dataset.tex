\begin{subsection}{Loader Dataset}
    \label{subsubsec:loader-dataset}
    \par This class, \texttt{loader-dataset.py}, is responsible for the methodology employed for data retrieval. It is the module that takes the most importance of the \texttt{utils} package, so it was worth describing it.
    \par The method used to get the data is holdout, there is more than one function involved in this.

    \par As planned, the learning data is completely separated from the testing data with the \texttt{learn\_mode} parameter.
    \par The learning set is, in turn, split into the train set for the training phase and in the eval set for the evaluation phase. Finally, the train set undergoes a data shuffle, this should make the train phase more robust. The eval set comes in handy to avoid overfitting.\\
    \par It is also important to note that the~\glsxtrshort{mnist}~allocates $60,000$ samples for training and $10,000$ for testing.
