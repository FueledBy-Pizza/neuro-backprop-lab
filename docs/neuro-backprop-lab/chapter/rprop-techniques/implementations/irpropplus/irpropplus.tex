\begin{subsection}{Improved Rprop with Weight-Backtracking}
    \par This~\glsxtrshort{rprop} version, also said~\glsxtrshort{irprop}\textsuperscript{+}, extends the one described in subsection~\ref{subsec:rpropplus}.
    \par The only modification concerns the gradient-product case resulting in less than zero: weight-backtracking is adopted only if the current error is greater than the previous error (this is what is meant by `improved'), otherwise the step size direction is set to zero.
